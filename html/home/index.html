			Since starting my journey as a full stack web developer nearly 4 years ago, I have built web solutions for diverse clients and collaborated with talented teams to develop impactful digital products for businesses and consumers. I’m confident, curious, and always refining my skills, tackling one coding challenge at a time.

			Beyond client work, I’m an advocate for open source, contributing to and maintaining projects that empower developers and promote community-driven innovation. Outside of coding, I stay energized and focused through calisthenics, embracing balance and discipline in my daily routine.
