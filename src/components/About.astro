<article class="biography">
	<p>My name is Jarlem Red de Peralta, born at Ilocos Norte, Philippines on October 21, 2000. My first name was derived from my father's name "Raj", and mother's name "Mel". At a young age, I was surrounded by various forms of modern technology with internet connectivity. I was always curious of what I could do with them. I also became a casual gamer, which also improved my computer literacy.

	<p>It was only during my late high school years that I discovered my passion in design and development. Fast forward to 2023, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Mabalacat City College. After accomplishing my capstone project along with my groupmates and my internship at a Front-end development driven company, I have been equipped with enough experience to pursue a career in web development.</p>

	<p>My journey as a Front-End Developer has been an rewarding adventure filled with continuous learning and growth. I started my career by diving into the basics of web development by learning the basics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). As I became more proficient in these, I challenged myself to explore modern frameworks like React and Vue, which broadened my perception in building interactive user interfaces.</p>

	<p>Throughout my journey, I have had the privilege of working on diverse projects with cross-functional teams, including UX/UI designers, back-end developers, and product managers. Collaborating with these professionals taught me the importance of effective communication and understanding the broader context of a project to deliver the best results. I've faced my fair share of challenges, too. Debugging complex issues, optimizing performance, and ensuring cross-browser compatibility have all tested my problem-solving skills. But with each hurdle, I've gained valuable experience that has made me a more resilient and efficient developer.</p>

	<p>One of the most fulfilling aspects of being a Front-End Developer is witnessing my work come to life. Whether it's a sleek e-commerce platform, an engaging social media app, or an informative blog, seeing users interact with the products I've helped build brings a sense of accomplishment and purpose to my career. As technology rapidly evolves, I've made a commitment to stay updated with the latest industry trends and best practices.</p>

	<p>Looking ahead, I'm excited about the endless possibilities in front-end development. As I continue to grow and evolve in this ever-evolving field, I'm eager to take on new challenges, embrace emerging technologies, and contribute to the advancement of the digital landscape. My journey as a Front-End Developer has just begun, and I can't wait to see where it takes me next.</p>
